Being one of the largest fests in the genre all over India, COMPOSIT, an abbreviation of Congress of Metallurgical Professionals involving Students, Industry, and Teachers, is one of India’s largest Materials Science Fest conducted by the Society of Metallurgical Engineers (SME), Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur. It is a unique congregation of students, professionals, academicians, and eminent personalities sharing the belief that materials will define the next revolution, a path-breaking concept to compile and share knowledge and enthusiasm for the development of ‘The Science of Materials.</p>

                                <p>Starting in 1994, It is a national congregation of bright and ambitious minds to invoke their innovation and bridge their ingenious thoughts and ideas into exorbitant assets for humanity.
